# 1xdev - platform

Set of platform functionality from the **1xdevelopers** for web development.

### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: A placeholder documentation site powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

Each package and app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This Turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Useful commands

- `pnpm build` - Build all packages and the docs site
- `pnpm dev` - Develop all packages and the docs site
- `pnpm lint` - Lint all packages
- `pnpm changeset` - Generate a changeset
- `pnpm clean` - Clean up all `node_modules` and `dist` folders (runs each package's clean script)

## Versioning and Publishing packages

Package publishing has been configured using [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets). Please review their [documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets#documentation) to familiarize yourself with the workflow.

This example comes with automated npm releases setup in a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/changesets/action). To get this working, you will need to create an `NPM_TOKEN` and `GITHUB_TOKEN` in your repository settings. You should also install the [Changesets bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) on your GitHub repository as well.

For more information about this automation, refer to the official [changesets documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/automating-changesets.md)
